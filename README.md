Description


use java email for poker program I have a SendMail program and a ReceiveMail. Programs are self explanatory.

SendMail sends an email with message templates like - "username" bets "amount" which takes username and amount variables from the table prgram. ReceiveMail receives and loads newest email in inbox and sends the username and amount variable to the table program.
